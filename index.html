    <div id="about">
        <p>
            Until nearly two decade ago, our understanding of how planets revolve around a star and how life forms on the planet was based only
            on one sample set – Earth and its solar-system. As NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope science team was wrapping up a 10-day trial
            run, they saw something that bordered on the unbelievable, the telescope's first detection of a rocky, Earth-sized world outside
            our solar system. Astronomers in the recent years have made significant progress in expanding the database
            of planets outside of our solar system. These extrasolar planets are termed as Exoplanets.
        </p>
        <p>These worlds come in a huge variety of sizes and orbits. Some are gigantic planets hugging close to their parent stars, while others are icy,
            and some are rocky. Most of these exoplanets have been found by NASA's Kepler mission. NASA and other agencies are looking for a special
            kind of planet, one that’s the same size as Earth, orbiting a sun-like star in the habitable zone.
        </p>
        <p>The habitable zone is the range of distances from a star where a planet’s temperature allows liquid water oceans, critical for life on Earth.
            The earliest definition of the zone was based on simple thermal equilibrium, but current calculations of the habitable zone include many
            other factors, including the greenhouse effect of a planet’s atmosphere. This makes the boundaries of a habitable zone fuzzy.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>METHODS OF DISCOVERY</h4>
        <h5 style="font-size: medium">Radial velocity</h5>
        <p>
            A star with a planet will move in its own small orbit in response to the planet's gravity. This leads to variations in the speed
            with which the star moves toward or away from Earth, i.e. the variations are in the radial velocity of the star with respect to Earth.
            The radial velocity can be deduced from the displacement in the parent star's spectral lines due to the Doppler effect.
            The radial-velocity method measures these variations in order to confirm the presence of the planet using the binary mass function.
        </p>
        <h5 style="font-size: medium">Transit Photometry</h5>
        <p>While the radial velocity method provides information about a planet's mass, the photometric method can determine the planet's radius.
            If a planet crosses (transits) in front of its parent star's disk, then the observed visual brightness of the star drops by a small amount;
            depending on the relative sizes of the star and the planet. For example, in the case of HD 209458, the star dims by 1.7%.
            This method has two major disadvantages. First, planetary transits are only observable when the planet's orbit happens to be perfectly aligned
            from the astronomers' vantage point. The second disadvantage of this method is a high rate of false detections. A 2012 study found that the
            rate of false positives for transits observed by the Kepler mission could be as high as 40% in single-planet systems.</p>
        <h5 style="font-size: medium">Astrometry</h5>
        <p>This method consists of precisely measuring a star's position in the sky, and observing how that position changes over time. Originally,
            this was done visually, with hand-written records. By the end of the 19th century, this method used photographic plates, greatly improving
            the accuracy of the measurements as well as creating a data archive. If a star has a planet, then the gravitational influence of the planet
            will cause the star itself to move in a tiny circular or elliptical orbit. Effectively, star and planet each orbit around their mutual
            center of mass, as explained by solutions to the two-body problem. Since the star is much more massive, its orbit will be much
            smaller. Frequently, the mutual center of mass will lie within the radius of the larger body. Consequently, it is easier to find planets
            around low-mass stars, especially brown dwarfs.</p>

        <h5 style="font-size: medium">Direct imaging</h5>
        <p>Planets are extremely faint light sources compared to stars, and what little light comes from them tends to be lost in the glare from their
            parent star. So in general, it is very difficult to detect and resolve them directly from their host star. Planets orbiting far enough from
            stars to be resolved reflect very little starlight, so planets are detected through their thermal emission instead. It is easier to obtain
            images when the star system is relatively near to the Sun, and when the planet is especially large (considerably larger than Jupiter),
            widely separated from its parent star, and hot so that it emits intense infrared radiation. Images have then been made in the infrared,
            where the planet is brighter than it is at visible wavelengths. Coronagraphs are used to block light from the star, while leaving the
            planet visible. Direct imaging of an Earth-like exoplanet requires extreme optothermal stability. During the accretion phase of
            planetary formation, the star-planet contrast may be even better in H alpha than it is in infrared – an H alpha survey is currently underway.
        </p>

        <h5 style="font-size: medium">Gravitational microlensing</h5>
        <p>
            Gravitational microlensing occurs when the gravitational field of a star acts like a lens, magnifying the light of a distant background star.
            This effect occurs only when the two stars are almost exactly aligned. Lensing events are brief, lasting for weeks or days, as the two stars
            and Earth are all moving relative to each other. More than a thousand such events have been observed over the past ten years.

                We've always wondered if we are in that special place in this universe, where life can sustain and there has always been that persistant
                curiosity to search for life outside of the earth, and that curiosity itself has led to the discovery of more than 3400 extrasolar planets
                out of which over 700 are in the habitable zone. The habitable zone is defined as a range of temperature where earth like life can sustain.
                Though that looks very interesting, the data for these exoplanets contains thousands of details, so we thought why not present this data in a
                way where non-experts can ask more informed questions, and therefore our goal is to provide interactive infoviz, where users can easily identify
                earth-like planets.The data-set containing information about the physical and detection parameters of all the discovered exoplanets and
                “potential candidate” exoplanet is kept up-to-date by NASA and CALTECH.
            </p>
            <p>
                We started with a very abstract bubble chart to sort the planets by thier Earth Similarity Index that ranges between 0 & 1. The planets always
                revolve in radial orbits, and are arranged likewise sorted by their ESI values. The ones towards the inside are likely to be like earth and will
                have an ESI value closer to 1. They are also sized by the ESI values, with an option to scale them by actual radius values as well. The color
                encoding is the surface temperature of the planet which is key for habitation to exist.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next is a more informative scatterplot drawing comparisons between all the major attributes of the exoplanets against discovery year. The measure for y-axis can be toggled from
                the drop down to draw interesting comparisons. The points are colored as per the method of discovery. Since most planets were found recently, we added zoom feature to the
                plot for users to closely view specific planets from the clusters. Hovering over any planet shows the important information in a tooltip.
                to further drill down clicking on any of the planets leads to it's own solar system. The planets are displayed revolving around the star with thier radial velocity. A blue
                circle represents the earth orbit for reference. You can mouse over the planets to pause the animation and gain interesting information about the planets. A green patch if visible shows
                the habitable zone in the system

        <h4>SKETCHES</h4>
        <p style="font-size: medium">Design 1</p>
        <p>Some of the early designs that we laid out were on pen and paper, and really were continuously modified as we played more with the data.
        We had chalked out some more that were not taken into implementation due to data constraints.</p>
        <p>
            This one below was the first insight we had after looking at the dataset, and also ended up as one of the implementations. However, since we
            only had the discovery year of the exoplanets, the measure for x-axis in our design, the final result wasn't as scattered as we had foreseen.

        <p>
            We really wanted something that could give a high-level summary view of these planets as being earth-like. Therefore, we though of using the
            Earth similarity index value as a measure to arrange the habitable planets in radial orbits.

            <h3 > Earth Similarity Index Visualization</h3>
            <p>
                This visualization gives us a measure of the Earth Similarity Index value for some of the exoplanets discovered till date. A number of measures
                related to the exoplanet such as radius, velocity, temperature are taken into consideration to calculate the ESI value. It falls in the range of 0-1,
                1 meaning completely like Earth, and 0 meaning completely unlike Earth</p>
            <p>
                Planets shown in the outermost circle are the ones with the least ESI value, i.e. they are least likely to be like Earth. As we move towards
                the inside the ESI value increases by a factor of 0.1 with decreasing circumference. The planets are scaled by the ESI value initially,
                however you can also scale them by their actual radius values as well. They will still remain sorted by the ESI values moving from outside orbits to inside ones.
                You can click on the planet to zoom into it, and hover over to get more generic information about them.

            <p>This is a visualization drawing comparisons between some of the most important attributes of the exoplanets.
                Each circle in the visualization is a planet. The color encoding is done on the basis of the method of discovery.</p>
            <p>The scatter plot has x-axis as Year of discovery of the exoplanet and y-axis measure can be chosen from planet’s distance from earth in parsecs,
                mass and radii with respect to Jupiter, orbital period in days and planets with habitable zone.</p>
