    </div>
    <p style="color: #FFFFFF">As NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope science team was wrapping up a 10-day trial run, they saw something that bordered on the unbelievable: the telescope's first detection of a rocky, Earth-sized world outside our solar system.
        Exoplanets are planets beyond our own solar system. Thousands of them have been discovered in the past two decades, mostly with NASA's Kepler space telescope. At,
    present they total upto more than 3400 and increasing everyday. </p>
    <p style="color: #FFFFFF">These worlds come in a huge variety of sizes and orbits. Some are gigantic planets hugging close to their parent stars; others are icy, some rocky.
        NASA and other agencies are looking for a special kind of planet: one that’s the same size as Earth, orbiting a sun-like star in the habitable zone.
    </p>
    <p style="color: #FFFFFF">The habitable zone is the range of distances from a star where a planet’s temperature allows liquid water oceans, critical for life on Earth. The earliest definition of the zone was based on simple thermal equilibrium, but current calculations of the habitable zone include many other factors, including the greenhouse effect of a planet’s atmosphere. This makes the boundaries of a habitable zone "fuzzy."</p>

        <h3 > Earth Similarity Index Visualization</h3>
        <p>This visualization gives us a measure of the Earth Similarity Index value for some of the exoplanets discovered till date. A number of measures
        related to the exoplanet such as radius, velocity, temperature are taken into consideration to calculate the ESI value. It falls in the range of 0-1,
        1 meaning completely like Earth, and 0 meaning completely unlike Earth</p>
        <p>The planets(white) shown in the outermost circle are the ones with the least ESI value, i.e. they are least likely to be like Earth. As we move towards
            the inside the ESI value increases by a factor of 0.1 with decreasing circumference. You can click on the planet to zoom into it, and hover over to
            get more generic information about them.

    <h3>Exoplanet Attributes Scatterplot </h3>
    <p>This is a visualization drawing comparisons btween some of the most important attributes of the exoplanets.
        Each dot in the visualization is a planet. The color encoding is done on the basis of the method of discovery.</p>
    <p>The scatter plot has x-axis as Year of discovery of the exoplanet and y-axis measure can be chosen from planet’s distance from earth in parsecs,
        mass and radii with respect to Jupiter, orbital period in days and planets with habitable zone.</p>
    <p>A user can zoom into the scatter plot, and get a closer view of these planets on the plot, and also hover over these planets to
    get details about them. The habitable planet measure if selected, will show only the planets that are in the habitable zone, which
    in turn is calculated using different measure values.</p>
